  "description" : "[h1] Important Info - Now Compatible with FR (Frackin' Races).\n [/h1]\nEdited version of MadTulips Spaceship Mod.\nIt includes \"MadTulips/Elithian Compat Patch\" & \"MadTulips Spaceship Mod Configuration - No Life Support System\" + some of my and Sentient Cookie edits so it doesn't replace starting ships (you will need FU or similar mods to be able to build your own ship).\nIt should be compatible with all custom races because it no longer changes starting ships, for that i recommend FU, and if you use custom races \"[OFFICIAL] FU BYOS Modded Race Support\" .\nI am still testing it but so far i didn't have any compability issues with FU or 300 other mods i use.\n\nCredits:\nOriginal Mod: http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=729640289\nMadTulips/Elithian Compat Patch: http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=913392697&searchtext=MadTulips\nMadTulips Spaceship Mod Configuration - No Life Support System: \nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=743828258&searchtext=MadTulips\nFU (Frackin' Universe): http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=729480149&searchtext=frackin\n[OFFICIAL] FU BYOS Modded Race Support: http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1194878261&searchtext=byos\n\nP.S. : MadTulips Spaceship Mod is not required nor should it be used with this mod, the same goes for the two patches named in the description of this mod. The ships in the screenshots and in the video are not by me or added by the mod, they only show what can be done with the mod. Compatible with FR but FR is not required.",
